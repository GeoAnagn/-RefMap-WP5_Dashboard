                "The climate impact of non-CO₂ emissions, which account for two-thirds of aviation’s radiative forcing, is heavily influenced by atmospheric chemistry and weather conditions.",
                "There is significant potential to reduce these effects by avoiding 'climate-sensitive regions' (areas where non-CO₂ impacts are enhanced). This is achieved by planning aircraft trajectories to reroute around these specific atmospheric conditions.",
                "While promising in theory, flight planning at the individual trajectory scale (micro-scale) faces major obstacles when applied to global traffic scenarios. Air Traffic Management (ATM) is a complex multi-agent system, its collective behavior relies on the interaction between individual trajectories and the wider ATM network (macro-scale).",

                "Planning trajectories in isolation introduces several cascading <b>challenges<b>:",
                "<b><h4>1. Traffic Displacement</h4></b> Adopting climatically optimized trajectories evacuates regions sensitive to warming but increases congestion in \"cooling\" climate-sensitive areas.",
                "<b><h4>2. Increased Complexity</h4></b> This shift in air traffic flow drastically increases traffic complexity in these newly congested regions.",
                "<b><h4>3. Safety Hazards</h4></b> The resulting congestion poses potential safety risks that individual planning cannot foresee.",
                "Because of these interdependencies, environmental benefits cannot be evaluated by looking at single flights alone. It is essential to conduct analyses at the network level, accounting for the collective behavior of all flights within the system to ensure both environmental mitigation and operational safety."
